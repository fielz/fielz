Born in Feb. 93 before MP3 was released, 
I never really moved from my studio, but I was playing lego™ and mecano toys as a kid because the control room of my studio was my bedroom, the record room was my sister's bedroom... she used to study a lot to be a doctor now, big shout out to her ! i'm so proud so I let it be known from everybody. 
now it's my turn to enhance the game.
I brand solo genius to build this music studio record, mixing, mastering, radio, TV, and much more out of my studio... 
I made it with my 2 hands, now I look for people in same range to build together a promising future with some
 " savoir-faire " . 
Gifted, I holla at y'all from the 

Bx Zé Studios, 

Welcome

best regards.
